Ideas

General Ideas
Entangled - replace the region proposal network and semantic segmenting network with Normal VGG encoding and Key point detector
Use Image Transformers - joint probability distribution of pixels, parallel procesisng - image generation model converted to image representation model

Image Encoding Plans
Keypoint descriptors 
Reduce max sequence size - histogram
Vague Idea : Try to focus more on extracting features containing information about correlation between sequence images and not more on general encoding
Try dropping frames - train transformer itself to predict which frames to drop - unsupervised, evaluate during testing

Text side Ideas
Ignore glosses, end to end training with images and translation sentences
Use BLEU score and not accuracy


Model Compression Techniques
Pruning, Quantization, Reduce bottleneck layers and FFN layer weights, Use weight sharing networks instead
